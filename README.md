# fredsted-roundcube

This is my personal skin for roundcube. I'm bad at naming stuff, so I just called it "fredsted".

It's based on the theme roundcube comes with. I wrote it to be a little darker than the normal theme, flatter and more like the design of icloud.com (at least the login box).

## Installing

Installing a roundcube theme is literally the easiest thing in the world.

* put the "fredsted" folder insude your /`[roundcuberoot]`/`skins`/.
* select the skin in `Settings` when logging in to roundcube.
