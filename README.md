fredsted-roundcube
==================

This is my personal skin for roundcube. I'm bad at naming stuff, so I just called it "fredsted".

I wrote it to be a little darker than the normal theme, more flatter and more like icloud.com.

It's based on the theme roundcube comes with, "class", and I've made lots of modifications, so
basically some of it is a whole new skin. You can see a demo at https://mail.fredsted.me/

Installing
==========

To install, 

* put the "fredsted" folder insude your /[roundcuberoot}/skins/.
* select skin in Preferences when logging in to roundcube.
